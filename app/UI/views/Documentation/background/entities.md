# Entities

Entities are concepts that possess relative stability, that is, they do not change rapidly over time. 
In a simplified way, entities "exist", while relations (events, states, qualities) "happen". 
In general, the "definition" of an entity is, in fact, a description of the relationships that the concept has with other concepts.

## Dimensions
In FrameNet, entities are modeled equally, independent of its *conceptual dimension*:
- Reality: "Real" entities (physical, psychological, or social world) and "supernatural" entities 
(mythological, religious, hypothetical, imagined, simulated, expected, projected, or dreamed world).
- Nature: "Natural" entities (that exist naturally, are not created by humans) and "artifactual" entities (created by humans for a purpose).
- Essence: "Concrete" entities (exist in the physical world), "abstract" entities (exist in the psychological or social world), and "representational" entities (exist to represent - re-present - other entities).
