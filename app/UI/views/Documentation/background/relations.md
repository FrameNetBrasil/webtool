# Relations

Relations represent structural or functional **links** between entities or events. 
They include spatial, temporal, causal, part-whole, and epistemic relations. 
Examples include *Cause*, *Sequence*, *Part_Whole*, *Similarity*, *Contrast*.

Relations are crucial for compositional semantics and for building scenarios that combine multiple frames coherently.
