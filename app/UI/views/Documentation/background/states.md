# States

A State represent static conditions that **hold over time** without internal change. Examples include *Ownership*, *Health_State*, *Emotional_State*.

A State is a Situation that persists over some duration without internal transition or inherent unfolding from one phase to another. 
It describes a static condition, configuration, or status of an entity or set of entities. 
Unlike an *Event*, a state does not inherently describe a change or an activity. 
However, a state can change, and the change from one state to another would be an Event. Some criteria:

- Persistence over Duration: A State is characterized by its duration, during which its defining conditions remain constant. It is not instantaneous like some Events.
- Lack of Intrinsic Dynamics/Internal Transition: A state does not involve an inherent progression or internal activity. It is a stable condition, even if it is temporary. 
The beginning or end of a state, or the transition between states, would be an Event.
- Cognitive Stability: Cognitively, states are understood as relatively stable configurations of entities and their relationships.
- Result of a Event (often): Many states are the result or outcome of an Event (e.g., Agreement resulting from Negotiation; ProblemResolution resulting from SolutionSteps).

They may function as background conditions or targets of change.
