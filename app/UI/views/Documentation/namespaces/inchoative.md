# Inchoative Namespace

## Core Definition

Inchoative frames foreground the **TELIC ROLE**, specifically emphasizing the **achievement of a new state** by an affected entity. 
These frames center on the Patient/Theme undergoing a transition, with the focus on the **resultant state** and the **coming-into-being** 
of that state rather than on the causer or the path of change.

**Theoretical foundation**: Inchoatives encode the basic semantic template `BECOME(State(x))`, where an entity `x` transitions into a new state. 
The core insight is that inchoatives **profile the endpoint** - they are inherently **telic** (goal-oriented) and conceptualize events from 
the perspective of the affected entity achieving a new configuration.

**Key characteristics**:
- **Patient/Theme-centric**: The affected entity is the primary participant
- **Endpoint-focused**: The resultant state is semantically salient
- **State-transition**: Encodes change from State₁ to State₂
- **No obligatory causer**: Causation may be present but is backgrounded or absent

**Vendler aspectual class**: Achievements (punctual) or Accomplishments (durative with inherent endpoint)

## Change types in Inchoative Frames

Inchoatives are not uniform - they vary based on **what kind of change** is profiled. We can distinguish several major types.

### Physical State Change

**Definition**: Change in the physical structure, integrity, or material properties of an entity.

**Semantic template**: `BECOME(Physical_State(x))`

**Examples**:
- *O vaso quebrou* ("The vase broke") - structural integrity change
- *O gelo derreteu* ("The ice melted") - phase transition (solid → liquid)
- *A corda arrebentou* ("The rope snapped") - physical rupture
- *O metal enferrujou* ("The metal rusted") - material degradation
- *A madeira apodreceu* ("The wood rotted") - organic decomposition

#### Subtypes

**a) Destruction/Damage**:
- *quebrar* (break), *rasgar* (tear), *partir* (split), *romper* (rupture)
- Result: Loss of physical integrity or function
- Often irreversible

**b) Material transformation**:
- *derreter* (melt), *evaporar* (evaporate), *congelar* (freeze), *solidificar* (solidify)
- Result: Phase/state change in matter
- May be reversible (freeze ↔ melt)

**c) Surface/property change**:
- *enferrujar* (rust), *amarelar* (yellow), *escurecer* (darken), *amolecer* (soften)
- Result: Change in surface properties or material characteristics
- Often gradual/incremental

**Diagnostic features**:
- Typically visible/observable physical change
- Can be verified by inspection: *O vaso está quebrado*
- Often involves loss or gain of physical properties

### Property/Attribute Change

**Definition**: Change in scalar properties, qualities, or attributes without necessarily changing physical structure.

**Semantic template**: `BECOME(Property(x, degree))`

**Examples**:
- *O ambiente esfriou* ("The environment cooled") - temperature decrease
- *O produto encareceu* ("The product became expensive") - price increase  
- *A situação melhorou* ("The situation improved") - quality increase
- *O debate esquentou* ("The debate heated up") - intensity increase (metaphorical)
- *A empresa cresceu* ("The company grew") - size/scale increase

**Key feature**: **Scalar structure** - these involve change along a dimension or scale

#### Scalar types

**a) Temperature scale**:
- *esquentar/aquecer* (heat up), *esfriar* (cool down)
- Scale: cold ←→ hot

**b) Quality/value scale**:
- *melhorar* (improve), *piorar* (worsen)
- Scale: bad ←→ good

**c) Size/quantity scale**:
- *crescer* (grow), *aumentar* (increase), *diminuir* (decrease), *encolher* (shrink)
- Scale: small ←→ large

**d) Intensity scale**:
- *intensificar* (intensify), *fortalecer* (strengthen), *enfraquecer* (weaken)
- Scale: weak ←→ strong

#### Diagnostic features
- Can be modified by degree expressions: *muito, pouco, um pouco, bastante*
- Often have comparative forms: *A situação melhorou mais que antes*
- May not involve visible physical change (e.g., price, value)

### Locational/Spatial Change

**Definition**: Change in spatial location, position, or configuration (overlaps with Transition namespace - see boundary discussion below).

**Semantic template**: `BECOME(Located_at(x, Location))`

**Examples**:
- *A porta abriu* ("The door opened") - change in position/configuration
- *O balão subiu* ("The balloon rose") - vertical displacement
- *A flor desabrochou* ("The flower bloomed") - spatial unfolding
- *O leque abriu* ("The fan opened") - configuration change

#### Inchoative vs. Transition 
- **Inchoative reading**: Focuses on achieved configuration (*abriu* = is now in open state)
- **Transition reading**: Focuses on path of motion (*subiu* = moved along upward path)

#### Diagnostic
Inchoative locational changes typically involve:

- Configuration change of single entity (not movement through space)
- Resultant state is primary (*A porta está aberta*)
- Path is not elaborated or profiled

### State/Condition Change

**Definition**: Change in abstract state, condition, or status (social, psychological, legal, etc.).

**Semantic template**: `BECOME(Condition(x))`

**Examples**:
- *João adoeceu* ("João became sick") - health state change
- *Maria enriqueceu* ("Maria became rich") - wealth state change
- *O contrato venceu* ("The contract expired") - temporal/legal state change
- *A fruta amadureceu* ("The fruit ripened") - maturation state
- *O país democratizou* ("The country democratized") - political state change

#### Subtypes

**a) Biological/health states**:
- *adoecer* (become sick), *sarar* (heal), *envelhecer* (age), *amadurecer* (mature)

**b) Social/economic states**:
- *enriquecer* (become rich), *empobrecer* (become poor), *formar-se* (graduate)

**c) Psychological/emotional states** (overlaps with Experiential namespace):
- *alegrar-se* (become happy), *entristecer-se* (become sad), *zangar-se* (become angry)

**d) Legal/institutional states**:
- *casar-se* (marry), *divorciar-se* (divorce), *aposentar-se* (retire)

#### Diagnostic features
- Often abstract - not directly visible
- May require social/institutional framework
- Result state may be permanent or reversible depending on type

### Existential Change (Coming-into/out-of-being)

**Definition**: Change in existence status - entity begins or ceases to exist.

**Semantic template**: `BECOME(Exist(x))` or `BECOME(¬Exist(x))`

**Examples**:
- *A empresa surgiu* ("The company emerged") - coming into existence
- *O problema apareceu* ("The problem appeared") - becoming manifest
- *A civilização desapareceu* ("The civilization disappeared") - ceasing to exist
- *O reino caiu* ("The kingdom fell") - ceasing to exist (metaphorical)
- *Nasceu uma nova era* ("A new era was born") - coming into existence (metaphorical)

#### Subtypes

**a) Coming into existence**:
- *surgir* (emerge), *aparecer* (appear), *nascer* (be born), *brotar* (sprout)

**b) Ceasing to exist**:
- *desaparecer* (disappear), *morrer* (die), *extinguir-se* (become extinct), *sumir* (vanish)

#### Special property
These often lack causative alternants:

- ✗ *João apareceu o problema* (ungrammatical)
- ✓ *João fez o problema aparecer* (periphrastic causative required)

## Gradability: Punctual vs. Gradual Change

Inchoative frames vary in whether the change is conceptualized as **instantaneous** (punctual) or **gradual** (durative).

### Punctual Inchoatives (Achievements)

**Definition**: The change is conceptualized as occurring at an instant, with no internal temporal structure.

**Semantic template**: `BECOME(State(x))` at time point `t`

**Examples**:
- *O vaso quebrou* ("The vase broke") - instant of breakage
- *A bomba explodiu* ("The bomb exploded") - instant of explosion
- *O galho partiu* ("The branch snapped") - instant of fracture
- *O balão estourou* ("The balloon popped") - instant of rupture

#### Aspectual properties
- **Incompatible with progressive** (without coercion):
  - ✗ *O vaso está quebrando* (requires special interpretation: slow-motion, iterative, or imminence)
  - ✓ *O vaso quebrou* (simple past, punctual)

- **Compatible with "em X tempo"** (in X time - point of completion):
  - ✓ *O vaso quebrou em um segundo*

- **Incompatible with "por X tempo"** (for X time - duration):
  - ✗ *O vaso quebrou por uma hora*

- **"Quase" (almost) test** - refers to event not happening:
  - *O vaso quase quebrou* = The vase almost broke (but didn't)

**Cognitive basis**: These changes are conceptualized as **threshold-crossing** - once a critical point is reached, the change is instantaneous and complete.

### Gradual Inchoatives (Accomplishments)

**Definition**: The change unfolds gradually over time, with measurable progression toward the endpoint.

**Semantic template**: `BECOME(State(x))` over interval `[t₁, t₂]`

**Examples**:
- *O gelo derreteu* ("The ice melted") - gradual phase transition
- *A fruta amadureceu* ("The fruit ripened") - gradual maturation
- *O metal enferrujou* ("The metal rusted") - gradual oxidation
- *A situação melhorou* ("The situation improved") - gradual improvement
- *A temperatura aumentou* ("The temperature increased") - gradual scalar change

#### Aspectual properties
- **Compatible with progressive**:
  - ✓ *O gelo está derretendo* (ongoing process)
  - ✓ *A situação está melhorando* (ongoing improvement)

- **Compatible with "por X tempo"** (for X time - duration of process):
  - ✓ *O gelo derreteu por duas horas* (process lasted two hours)

- **Compatible with "em X tempo"** (in X time - completion time):
  - ✓ *O gelo derreteu em duas horas* (completed in two hours)

- **"Quase" (almost) test** - can refer to partial completion:
  - *O gelo quase derreteu* = The ice almost melted (partially melted, or melting was interrupted)

- **Degree modification possible**:
  - ✓ *O gelo derreteu um pouco / bastante / completamente*

**Cognitive basis**: These changes involve **gradual accumulation** - properties change incrementally along a scale or dimension.

### The Punctual-Gradual Gradient

Many inchoatives can be construed either way depending on context and granularity:

**Example**: *A porta abriu*

**Punctual construal** (achievement):
- Focus: Instant when door transitions from closed to open
- Context: *A porta abriu de repente* ("The door opened suddenly")
- Aspectual behavior: ✗ *A porta está abrindo* (marked)

**Gradual construal** (accomplishment):
- Focus: Progressive process of opening
- Context: *A porta está abrindo lentamente* ("The door is opening slowly")
- Aspectual behavior: ✓ *A porta está abrindo* (natural)

**Factors affecting construal**:
1. **Temporal adverbials**: *de repente* forces punctual, *lentamente* forces gradual
2. **Progressive aspect**: Forces gradual interpretation
3. **Manner specification**: Elaborating manner suggests gradual process
4. **Physical reality**: Actual duration of event in world

## Result States: Process vs. Result Profiling

Inchoative frames differ in whether they profile the **process of change**, the **resultant state**, or **both**.

### Result-Profiling Inchoatives

**Focus**: The achieved state is primary; the process is backgrounded or irrelevant.

**Examples**:
- *O vaso quebrou* → Focus: *O vaso está quebrado* (broken state)
- *A porta abriu* → Focus: *A porta está aberta* (open state)
- *A água congelou* → Focus: *A água está congelada* (frozen state)

**Properties**:
- Strong implication of **resultant state**
- Can be tested: "X Verb-ed → X is Verb-ed"
- Result state persists after event completion
- Often lexicalized result state adjective: *quebrado, aberto, congelado*

**Syntactic evidence** - Result state readings with *estar*:
```
✓ O vaso está quebrado (result state of breaking)
✓ A porta está aberta (result state of opening)
✓ A água está congelada (result state of freezing)
```

### Process-Profiling Inchoatives

**Focus**: The process of change is primary; result state may be less prominent or temporary.

**Examples**:
- *A temperatura aumentou* → Focus on process of increasing (result state less salient)
- *O ambiente esfriou* → Focus on cooling process
- *A discussão esquentou* → Focus on intensification process

**Properties**:
- **Process** component is semantically salient
- Result state may be temporary or reversible
- Often scalar/gradual changes
- May not have stable result state adjective

**Syntactic evidence** - Difficulty with result state readings:
```
? A temperatura está aumentada (awkward - not a stable state)
? O ambiente está esfriado (awkward - esfriado not standard adjective)
✓ A temperatura aumentou (process interpretation natural)
```

### Ambiguous Inchoatives (Process + Result)

Some inchoatives profile both equally:

**Example**: *A fruta amadureceu* ("The fruit ripened")

**Process reading**:
- ✓ *A fruta está amadurecendo* (ongoing maturation process)
- ✓ *A fruta amadureceu durante uma semana* (week-long process)

**Result reading**:
- ✓ *A fruta está madura* (achieved state of ripeness)
- ✓ *A fruta amadureceu* (is now ripe)

Both aspects are equally accessible and semantically important.

## Causative Alternations

A defining property of many inchoatives is participation in the **causative-inchoative alternation** (also called anticausative alternation).

### The Alternation Pattern

**Transitive causative form**: `Agent CAUSE BECOME(State(Patient))`
- *João quebrou o vaso* ("João broke the vase")

**Intransitive inchoative form**: `BECOME(State(Theme))`
- *O vaso quebrou* ("The vase broke")

**Semantic relationship**:
- Same verb form in Portuguese (unlike English break/break vs. kill/die)
- Intransitive is **detransitivized** version - Agent is removed from argument structure
- Patient of transitive = Theme/Subject of intransitive
- Same result state in both

### **5.2 Alternating vs. Non-alternating Inchoatives**

#### Alternating inchoatives** (most common)

**Change of state verbs**:
- *abrir* (open): *João abriu a porta* ↔ *A porta abriu*
- *quebrar* (break): *Maria quebrou o vaso* ↔ *O vaso quebrou*
- *derreter* (melt): *O sol derreteu o gelo* ↔ *O gelo derreteu*
- *secar* (dry): *O vento secou a roupa* ↔ *A roupa secou*

**Diagnostic**: Patient can undergo change spontaneously or through external causation

#### Non-alternating inchoatives** (intransitive only)

**Inherently spontaneous**:
- *morrer* (die): ✓ *João morreu* ↔ ✗ *Maria morreu João*
  - (Must use suppletive causative: *Maria matou João*)
- *surgir* (emerge): ✓ *O problema surgiu* ↔ ✗ *João surgiu o problema*
- *florescer* (bloom): ✓ *A flor floresceu* ↔ ✗ *O jardineiro floresceu a flor*

#### Diagnostic

Change is conceptualized as internal/spontaneous - cannot be directly externally caused

**Why no alternation?**
1. **Biological processes**: *morrer, nascer, florescer* - involve internal biological programs
2. **Emergence events**: *surgir, aparecer* - involve coming-into-being without external manipulation
3. **Natural maturation**: *amadurecer* (in some uses) - internal development

### Morphological Marking of Alternation

Portuguese has several strategies for marking the inchoative in alternations:

**A) Zero marking** (most common):
- Same form for causative and inchoative
- *quebrar, abrir, fechar, derreter, secar*

**B) Reflexive *se*** (for some verbs):
- Inchoative marked with reflexive clitic
- *dissolver* (dissolve): *João dissolveu o açúcar* ↔ *O açúcar se dissolveu*
- *transformar* (transform): *A máquina transformou o material* ↔ *O material se transformou*
- *desenvolver* (develop): *Eles desenvolveram a tecnologia* ↔ *A tecnologia se desenvolveu*

**Semantic nuance of *se***: Often emphasizes spontaneity or lack of external agent

**C) Suppletive forms** (lexical causative ≠ lexical inchoative):
- *matar* (kill) ↔ *morrer* (die)
- *alimentar* (feed) ↔ *comer* (eat)
- Different lexical items, no morphological relationship

### **5.4 Theoretical Analysis of Alternation**

**Two main approaches**:

**Approach 1: Derivational relationship** (Levin & Rappaport Hovav)
- One form is basic, the other derived
- Either: Inchoative is basic, causative adds Agent
- Or: Causative is basic, inchoative removes Agent

**Approach 2: Underspecification** (Reinhart, Chierchia)
- Single lexical entry with underspecified event structure
- `[CAUSE] BECOME(State(x))`
- CAUSE component can be saturated (transitive) or unsaturated (intransitive)

**Evidence for underspecification in Portuguese**:
- Same verbal form (no morphological marking in many cases)
- Flexible argument realization
- Semantically, same result state

## Telic Structure: Encoding the Inherent Endpoint

Inchoatives are inherently **telic** - they have a built-in endpoint or goal state.

### What is Telicity?

**Telic events**: Have a **natural endpoint** after which the event cannot continue
- *O vaso quebrou* - endpoint: broken state achieved, cannot continue breaking

**Atelic events**: No natural endpoint, can continue indefinitely
- *João correu* - no inherent endpoint, can keep running

### How Inchoatives Encode Endpoints

**Lexically specified endpoint**:
The endpoint is part of the verb's lexical meaning

**Examples**:
- *abrir* - endpoint: open state
- *quebrar* - endpoint: broken state
- *derreter* - endpoint: liquid state
- *amadurecer* - endpoint: ripe state

**Test**: "in X time" (bounded) vs. "for X time" (unbounded)
```
✓ O gelo derreteu em 10 minutos (bounded - reached endpoint in 10 min)
✗ ?O gelo derreteu por 10 minutos (odd - implies endpoint was reached over 10 min)
  vs.
✗ ?João correu em 10 minutos (odd without goal)
✓ João correu por 10 minutos (unbounded duration)
```

### Scalar Endpoints

For scalar inchoatives, the endpoint is a **degree on a scale**:

**Absolute scalar endpoint**:
- *encher* (fill): endpoint = completely full
- *esvaziar* (empty): endpoint = completely empty
- *secar* (dry): endpoint = completely dry

**Test**: "Completamente" (completely)
```
✓ O tanque encheu completamente (reached maximum)
✓ A roupa secou completamente (reached minimum moisture)
```

**Relative scalar endpoint**:
- *crescer* (grow): endpoint = contextually determined size
- *melhorar* (improve): endpoint = contextually determined quality level

**Test**: No absolute maximum
```
✓ A empresa cresceu muito, mas pode crescer mais
✓ A situação melhorou, mas pode melhorar mais
```

### Degree Achievements (Kennedy & McNally)

Some inchoatives are **degree achievements** - they involve change along a scale with variable endpoints:

**Examples**:
- *esfriar* (cool): *A sopa esfriou* (cooled to some degree)
- *esquentar* (warm): *O ambiente esquentou* (warmed to some degree)
- *escurecer* (darken): *O céu escureceu* (darkened to some degree)

**Properties**:
- Endpoint is contextually determined (not absolute)
- Compatible with degree modifiers: *um pouco, bastante, muito*
- Can be stopped before "complete" endpoint: *A sopa esfriou um pouco*

**Contrast with absolute inchoatives**:
```
DEGREE: A sopa esfriou um pouco (partial cooling is natural)
ABSOLUTE: ?O vaso quebrou um pouco (partial breaking is marked - either broken or not)
```

## Stative Result Interpretation

Many inchoatives have corresponding **result state interpretations** that are stative rather than eventive.

### Event vs. Result State Readings

**Eventive inchoative reading**: Describes the event of change
- *A porta abriu às 3h* ("The door opened at 3pm") - event of opening

**Stative result reading**: Describes the resultant state
- *A porta está aberta* ("The door is open") - state of openness

### Syntactic Encoding of Result States

Portuguese uses different copulas and participial forms:

**Perfect participle with *estar*** (result state):
```
✓ O vaso está quebrado (the vase is broken - result state)
✓ A porta está aberta (the door is open - result state)
✓ A água está congelada (the water is frozen - result state)
```

**Adjective form** (sometimes identical to participle):
```
✓ aberto (open), quebrado (broken), congelado (frozen)
These can be used attributively: o vaso quebrado, a porta aberta
```

### Ser vs. Estar with Result States

Portuguese copula choice affects interpretation:

**Estar + participle** = result state (stage-level):
- *A porta está aberta* (temporary state resulting from opening event)

**Ser + participle** = permanent/inherent property (individual-level):
- *A porta é aberta* (awkward - suggests openness is permanent characteristic)
- Better: *A porta é grande* (inherent property)

**Exception**: Some participles with *ser* indicate passive voice:
- *O vaso foi quebrado por João* (passive event)
- vs. *O vaso está quebrado* (result state)

### Not All Inchoatives Have Stable Result States

Some inchoatives resist stative result interpretation:

**Process-focused inchoatives**:
```
✓ A temperatura aumentou (event)
✗ ?A temperatura está aumentada (awkward as result state)

✓ A situação melhorou (event)
? A situação está melhorada (marginal as result state - prefer "está melhor")
```

**Reasons**:
- Scalar changes without clear binary endpoints
- Temporary/reversible states
- Lack of lexicalized result state adjective

## Diagnostic Tests for Inchoative Frames

### Test 1: Inchoative Alternation
Does the verb have both transitive (causative) and intransitive (inchoative) forms?
```
✓ João abriu a porta / A porta abriu → INCHOATIVE
✗ João criou o projeto / *O projeto criou → NOT INCHOATIVE (creation, not change)
```

### Test 2: Result State
Does the verb entail a specific, verifiable result state?
```
✓ O vaso quebrou → O vaso está quebrado → INCHOATIVE
✗ João correu → ?João está corrido → NOT INCHOATIVE (activity)
```

### Test 3: Patient/Theme-Focus
Is the affected entity the primary participant (not the causer)?
```
✓ O gelo derreteu (focus on gelo) → INCHOATIVE
✗ João derreteu o gelo (focus on João) → CAUSATIVE
```

### Test 4: Telicity
Does the event have a natural endpoint?
```
✓ A água congelou em uma hora (bounded) → INCHOATIVE (telic)
✗ A água fluiu por uma hora (unbounded) → NOT INCHOATIVE (atelic)
```

### Test 5: BECOME decomposition
Can the verb be decomposed as BECOME(State)?
```
✓ quebrar = BECOME(broken) → INCHOATIVE
✗ correr ≠ BECOME(State) → NOT INCHOATIVE
```

## Boundary Cases: Inchoative vs. Other Namespaces

### Inchoative vs. Causative
Same verb, different argument structure:
- **Causative**: Agent causes change (*João quebrou o vaso*)
- **Inchoative**: Theme undergoes change (*O vaso quebrou*)

### Inchoative vs. Transition
- **Inchoative**: Focus on achieved state (*A porta abriu* = is now open)
- **Transition**: Focus on path/trajectory (*João foi para o Rio* = movement along path)

### Inchoative vs. Experiential
Psychological inchoatives overlap with experiential frames:
- *João alegrou-se* (became happy) - inchoative reading (state change)
- *João se alegrou com a notícia* (felt joy from news) - experiencer reading (psychological event)

### Inchoative vs. Action

**Core distinction**: **Agent presence** and **perspective**

**Inchoative** (No agent, result-focused):
```
O vaso quebrou (The vase broke)
- Theme: vaso (affected entity)
- No agent mentioned
- Focus: result state (broken)
- BECOME(broken(vaso))
```

**Action** (Agent present, activity-focused):
```
João correu (João ran)
- Agent: João (doer)
- Activity: running
- Focus: process of running
- ACT(João, run)
```

**Key differences**:
1. **Participant structure**:
   - Inchoative: Theme only (no agent)
   - Action: Agent required

2. **Semantic focus**:
   - Inchoative: Result/endpoint achieved
   - Action: Activity/process performed

3. **Telicity**:
   - Inchoative: Telic (has endpoint)
   - Action: Typically atelic (no endpoint)

**No direct overlap**: These namespaces are complementary rather than competing:
- Inchoatives describe changes without profiling causers
- Actions describe activities by agents without required results
