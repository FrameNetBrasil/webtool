# Working with Frames

This guide explains how to create, edit, and manage semantic frames in Webtool 4.2.

## Creating a New Frame

To create a new frame:

1. Navigate to **Frame > New Frame** from the main menu
2. Enter the frame name (e.g., "Commerce_buy")
3. Add a definition describing the conceptual structure
4. Define the frame elements (participants)

### Example

**Frame**: Commerce_buy

**Definition**: A Buyer exchanges Money for Goods with a Seller.

**Frame Elements**:
- **Buyer** (Core): The person acquiring the Goods
- **Seller** (Core): The person giving up the Goods
- **Goods** (Core): The items being exchanged
- **Money** (Core): The payment given for the Goods
- **Time** (Peripheral): When the transaction occurs
- **Place** (Peripheral): Where the transaction occurs

## Editing Frames

To modify an existing frame:

1. Search for the frame using the search interface
2. Click on the frame name to open the editor
3. Make your changes
4. Save the updated frame

## Frame Relations

Frames can be related to other frames through various relation types:

- **Inheritance**: Child frame inherits properties from parent
- **Using**: One frame uses another as background
- **Subframe**: Complex frame composed of simpler frames
- **Precedes/Follows**: Temporal ordering of frames

## Best Practices

- Use clear, descriptive names for frames
- Write comprehensive definitions
- Identify all core frame elements
- Document frame relations to build semantic networks
- Review similar frames to maintain consistency
