196,3381,"Cardinal_numbers","This frame presents a situation where there is a certain #Number of instances of an #Entity or a certain #Number that quantifies a #Unit. Numbers are used to count any kind of #Entity that has distinct individuals, or alternatively, to count #Units whose own function is to quantify some property, with the #Number associated with each word of this frame differentiating groups, individuals, parts of individual #Entitys of different sizes, or to differentiate the quantity of the #Units. A countable #Entity prototypically occupies its own space separately from other instances of the #Entity, and each instance of the #Entity has specific kinds of parts or substance or characteristics as specified by the kind of #Entity it is described as.   #Units (e.g., hours, inches, dozens) have the function of quantifying some property and as a result, naturally occur with a #Number to say how the current property compares to the standard quantification of the #Unit.  Less prototypical numbers, which occur much more frequently with #Units rather than #Entitys, describe situations with less than a whole #Unitor #Entity (half.n), or the lack of a #Unit or #Entity (zero.num).
<ex></ex>
There is also a #Precision associated with the #Number. In most cases, there is a certain amount of imprecision in the #Number that is assumed, especially for so-called """"round"""" numbers like twenty.num or hundred.num, and for the class of approximate numbers, like couple.n; for other numbers, e.g. two.num, the expected precision is very high. Separately from this inherent possibility of precision or imprecision, numbers may be modified by an explicit specification of their #Precision, with phrases like """"about"""", etc.

<ex></ex>
This frame includes extrathematic FEs for a set of non-lexical constructions that put together quantifying expressions.  Firstly, a #Number may itself be quantified by having a certain #Multiplier, e.g. """"three hundred"""".  Secondly, a sequence of numerical expressions may be strung together, with or without """"and"""", to produce a #Composite_number representing a #Number that is the sum of the constituent numbers and that collectively modifies the #Entity or #Unit.

<ex>Stephen has more than [five|mul] [[hundred|Number]|Target] in his closet! [DNI|Entity]</ex>
<ex></ex>
<ex></ex>
As can be seen in the first of the next two examples, when the target is a number in front of another number in the function of a #Multiplier, we consider the number it is modifying to be a #Unit:

<ex>There are just over [[six|Target]|Number] [billion|Unit] people in the world today.</ex>
<ex>There are [just over|deg] [six|Multiplier] [[billion|Num]|Target] [people|Entity] in the world today.</ex>

The relationship between numbers, as lexical units in this frame, and the broader category of numbers is a complex one.  In particular, there is a semiotic system that arranges the tiny set of numeral symbols (0, 1, 2 ... 9), with some additional symbols (commas, decimal points, fraction lines, scientific notation of exponents) to generate a standard representation for numbers that, while not universal, is at least language independent.  Our description of numbers is focused on the English system of numbers, as would occur in the spoken language or in pronunciations (actually decodings) of written numerals in English.  Since numerals are well-understood by virtually all speakers of most languages, and are well-processed by computers, we do not view the description of these structures in FrameNet as necessary.  As a convenience, we include numerals as wordforms when they coincide with a basic number word of English (e.g., """"3"""" is a wordform of three.num).
<ex></ex>
Of more interest for the FrameNet Project is the large number of idiosyncrasies in the constructions that use numbers, very few of which will be well-exemplified in our annotation.  These include indications of range (from ... to), approximation (in the neighborhood of), and descriptions of group properties (""""A whopping [three|Target] singers showed up"""")

<ex></ex>

Technical note: The frame as currently devised does not distinguish between """"six apples"""" and """"six of the apples"""".  It is clear that in the first case, we are talking about six entities that fit whatever properties apples have.  In the second case, however, there is a specific set of apples that was already under discussion, and the six apples are members of this set.  There is a way of understanding this second case in terms of the first, namely, that """"six of the apples"""" is interpreted as six entities with the property of being members of the given set of apples.  Since understanding the second case involves an additional notion of set membership, this could be indicated with a different FE than any we currently have in this frame, perhaps *Set, which is in an exclusion relation with Entity.  However, the major semantic distinction between these two types of #Entity is whether there is a definite set, and this distinction is independently indicated by the definite article in examples like """"six of the apples"""".

Similarly, Citing differs from Entering_of_plea because its scenario encompasses more than the latter; Citing involves steps both before and after the #Defendant enters a Plea in answer to #Charges. Finally, this frame differs from Fining since the #Defendant (Payer in the Fining frame) does not necessarily end up paying a #Fine. He or she may go to #Court instead. "

193,3378,"Direction","This frame covers the basic uses of direction words like the adverbs east, up, and forward.  These are used either to talk about a direction of facing (e.g., facing outward, pointing left, looking downward, turn east) or to talk about actual or metaphorical motion (went up, traveling due north).  Lexical units of this frame typically have a semantic type that refers to the means of determining the direction (e.g. forward.adv has the semantic type Landmark_front, meaning that """"forward"""" is defined with respect to the direction from the center of some entity to its front, however defined).  Nevertheless, some words like way.n and direction.n are used exactly when normal means of specifying direction are not available, and obligatorily occur with some other means of specifying the direction (""""that way"""", """"the same way"""", """"the direction she went"""").

This frame is most frequently used to describe the motion of something along the #Path from the #Landmark, which is normally implicitly identified as the location of the viewpoint:

<ex>We went [[north|Path]|Target] . [DNI|Landmark]</ex>

In such cases, a #Distance from the #Landmark can also be given:

<ex>After she was knocked on the head , it seemed like everything had moved [three feet|Distance] <m>to</m> the [left|Target] . [DNI|Landmark]</ex>

It can often be used for direction of facing, which is not compatible with the #Distance frame element:

<ex>Look [[left|Path]|Target] and you 'll see it . [DNI|Landmark] </ex>

Although rare for certain lexical units (e.g., upward.adv), most words in this frame are commonly used in a fictive motion pattern to identify locations that can be reached by moving in the indicated way from the #Landmark:

<ex>The book was unreachable, [10 feet|Distance] [[up|Path]|Target] on the shelf. [DNI|Landmark]</ex>
<ex>[[East|Target]|Path] [of Mt. Diablo|Landmark] the Sierras rise majestically above the Central Valley.</ex>
<ex></ex>

In this fictive motion case, the #Domain and the #Independent_variable are both spatial, and should be marked as metaphorical.

Note this differs from members of the Directional_locative_relation frame (e.g., above.prep), which can only be used for relative static positions, and not for facings or for directions of motion:

<ex>??? The book faced [above|Target] the door .</ex>
vs.
<ex>The book faced [upward|Target] .</ex>

A potential point of confusion is that the Directional_locative_relation frame is also used for cases in which adverbs like east.adv, etc. are followed by """"of"""", since such expressions can only be used of static relative positions and not facings:

<ex>??? I faced [east|Target] of the mountains .</ex>

Another potential point of confusion is that nouns referring to directions can be used for facings if they are preceeded by the word """"to"""".  Since this use of to.prep can be found with a broader class of words like side.n, we interpret this sense of to.prep as mapping relative postitions (belonging to the Directional_locative_relation frame) to true Directions, in the sense of this frame.  This applies to expressions like """"to the east"""", as well as """"to both sides"""" and """"to the rear"""".  In the future, we may add these as multi-word members of the frame.

In the following case, the #Domain is """"potency"""" and the #Independent_variable is, as usual, time; again, the example should be marked as metaphorical.

<ex></ex>
<ex>They decided to rerate the medication [downward|Target] [in potency|Domain] .</ex>
<ex></ex>

In mathematical terms, all of these uses can be understood as a #Path, made up of a set of positions in some N-space #Domain (by default spatial, or metaphorically, other domains), being determined as a function of a #Landmark (which may be incorporated and is usually implicit) and some one-dimensional #Independent_variable (time, or, metaphorically, other domains).  The #Domain and/or the #Independent_variable are normally incorporated in the basic definition of the target; thus, for example, up.adv, by default, indicates the #Domain is space, and time is the #Independent_variable. From a linguistic point of view, we consider these literal spatio-temporal uses to be basic, and other cases, where space is replaced by some other kind of quantity, is to be understood as metaphorical."

This frame also covers several productive metaphor cases. In the first one, movement or change caused by a social entity is conveyed as energy exerted by a physical entity. 'Social' here encompasses entities that are economic, political, technological, historical, cultural, and intimate:

<ex>Singh had been under [intense|Target] [political pressure|Exer].</ex>
<ex>[Economies|Exer] are [still|Tim] [sluggish|Target].</ex>
Relatedly, the influential effect of an psychological entity is described in terms of energy exertion by a physical entity. 'Psychological' includes the intellectual, emotional, and creative:
<ex>[Sinead's|Exer] [emotional|Dom] [intensity|Target] permeates every nuance of every lyric.</ex>
<ex>He finds [the Poet Laureate's theory about Shakespeare|Exer] to be [more|Deg] [energetic|Target] [than persuasive|Deg].</ex>
Both metaphors appear to involve a third metaphor, which is the anthropomorphization of processes (see examples directly above) or inhuman entities (e.g. in nature):
<ex>The [lazy|Target] [creak|Act] of sails</ex>
<ex>The [energetic|Target] [waves|Exer]</ex>
<ex>A broad, [lethargic|Target] [river|Exer]</ex>

Further, there is a metonymy wherein energy exerted by people carrying out an activity characterizes instead a central object or other component of the activity:
<ex>Lucker plays [lazy|Target] [games|Act].</ex>

<ex></ex>
Because these words serve to indicate hesitancy, often for purposes of increased politeness, speakers may use several encodings of hedging simultaneously to iconically indicate the degree of politeness or hesitancy that they wish to express:

<ex>Your story, is, [like|Target], [kind of|Target] a bit [on the|Target] short [side|Target] .</ex>

<ex>When a standard vaccuum can't even pick up the clods, you know [you've|Hedged_content] [kinda|Target] [got a problem|Hedged_content].</ex>
<ex></ex>
Words expressing small quantities or degrees (e.g., """"a tad"""", """"a little"""", etc.) can be used in a very similar function to words of this frame.  However, these words do not simply signify hesitation, but merely frequently imply it when used to modify a predication.  Such words can only be used on their on or with a noun to signify a small quantity or number (""""a little whiskey"""", see Proportional_quantity), or with an adjective to indicate that the quality described by the adjective is close to average (""""a mite stupid"""", """"somewhat confused"""" see Degree).  Words of those frames may be nested within noun phrases or in other positions where content is not asserted but rather presupposed.  Words that belong to the Hedging frame, by contrast, either take a noun complement and indicate hesitancy or imprecision concerning the category (""""something of a klutz""""), or modify an entire proposition to indicate imprecision of the proposition (""""I, like, waved it around"""").  In both cases, the #Hedged_content must occur in the at-issue focus of a proposition, the part of a statement that the speaker is, so to speak, on record as asserting."

That physical force may cause deformation or breakage of, or simply motion in the receiving entity. The receiving entity is conceptually present (even if remotely), but is usually not lexically explicit. This frame covers both individual-level/static uses (""""a STRONG person"""") as well as stage-level/dynamic uses (""""a STRONG push""""). However, the durative, individual-level meaning appears more frequently in the data and seems more basic.

<ex>A [powerful|Target] [force|For] tore off the tree's branches.</ex>

#Exerter, #Action, and #Force belong to a Core set.
<ex></ex>

There are several productive metaphors covered by this frame. The first and most common is one in which social influence or control is conceptualized as the physical exertion of force. The social influence/control is more specifically a propensity to cause change in social realms such as the economic, political, militaristic, cultural, or intimate:
<ex>There were theoretical limits to the [power|Target] [of the king|Exer].</ex>
<ex>Voters in the South have a [strong|Target] [incentive|Exer] to keep such Democrats in office.</ex>

Another similar metaphor is one in which psychological influence or control is understood as the physical exertion of force. The psychological influence/control includes the emotional as well:
<ex>[Poetic words in a text|Exer] can be <m>given</m> [more|Deg] [emotive|Dom] [power|Target] by using melisma.</ex>
<ex>He was a [forceful|Target] [speaker|Exer].</ex>

A third metaphor involves the amount of an entity construed as the physical force exertion of said entity. Depending on context, amount could be volume, etc. (“STRONGEST critics”; “MIGHTY uproar”).

<ex></ex>

Two related physical force dynamic frames are Level_of_force_resistance and Dynamism.
This frame is distinguished from the Level_of_force_resistance frame in that it describes the level of force <m>exertion</m> instead of the level of <m>resistance</m>, and also in that there are three categories of core FE available to the target (i.e #Exerter, #Action, or #Force), whereas in Level_of_force_resistance there are only two core FEs (i.e. Resisting_entity and Opposing_force). Of the latter frame's FEs, Opposing_force specifies the thing that the main entity resists to a level desginated by the target. Its parallel in Level_of_force_exertion is implied but backgrounded to the extent that it rarely appears as explicit lexical material; thus there is no corresponding core FE.

This frame differs from Dynamism with regard to individual-level cases; targets here express the FE's <m>capability</m>. In contrast, Dynamism targets express the FE's <m>tendency</m>. For example, """"a STRONG person"""" is generally construed as a person who is <m>capable</m> of strength, while """"an ENERGETIC person"""" (energetic.a from the Dynamism frame) is construed as a person who <m>tends</m> to be energetic.

However, there is overlap between the two frames in stage-level cases - """"a STRONG push"""" and """"an ENERGETIC push"""" seem rather comparable. "
1392,24040,"Level_of_force_resistance","A #Resisting_entity is capable of resisting or does resist a physical #Opposing_force to a level specified by the target. With certain LUs (e.g. <m>impregnable.a</m>), the #Opposing_force FE is incorporated, and with many LUs, it is mostly null instantiated. This frame covers both individual-level/static uses (""""the DURABILITY of jade"""") as well as stage-level/dynamic uses (""""the shoulder is PLIABLE after stretching""""), although the individual-level meaning is the more basic and is much more prominent in the data.

<ex>The great and [impregnable|Target] [fortress|Ent] still stands today.</ex>

<ex>[The staircase|Ent] <m>remained</m> [robust|Target] [under decades of heavy use|Opp].</ex>

Productive metaphors include cases where the social resistance of an entity to (an) opposing social force(s) is conceptualized as the physical resistance of an entity to an opposing physical force. More specifically, the ‘resistance’ is an entity’s propensity to resist change in social realms such as the economic, political, and cultural:
<ex>California has had (until now) a [robust|Target] [property market|Ent]. [INI|Opp]</ex>
<ex>The [durability|Target] [of the peace|Ent] will soon be tested. [INI|Opp]</ex>

Similarly, there are instances where the entity’s resistance is psychological instead of social, where ‘psychological’ subsumes emotional and other mental properties:

Such scenarios are covered by the Impact and Friction frames. The current frame also does not cover cases where an animate Agent or a natural Force or Cause causes a single Source or several Sources (moving or rubbing against each other) to make noise. Such scenarios are  covered by the Cause_to_make_noise, Cause_impact, and *Cause_friction frames (the last of which is not yet in FrameNet).

Understanding the #Mitigating_situation is therefore dependent on understanding the better and the worse situations, one or the other or both of which normally have already been mentioned or strongly evoked in the discourse.

When the [Mitigating_situation|MS] clause involves a negation, like in the first example above, the non-negated form is generally taken to be the worse situation - potentially also in combination with previous discourse context. (i.e. Perhaps there's been a blizzard.  The better situation is that a blizzard did not occur.  The mitigating situation is that a blizzard occurred, but I don't have to go to school.  The worse situation would be that a blizzard occurred, and I also have to go to school.)
<ex></ex>
Targets in this frame frequently occur in constructions that obscure the full <ex>#Mitigating_situation:</ex>

<ex>There will be no exceptions -- [not for you|Mitigating_situation], [at any rate|Target].</ex>
In this example, there is a fragment ellipsis construction that depends on the semantics of the immediately preceding context.
<ex></ex>
Lexical Units of this frame also frequently occur with the use of <m>or</m> that conveys a speaker self-correction or hedge. The function of this sort of <m>or</m> is to introduce contradictory possibilities without endorsing any of them.  In combination with targets of the Presentation_of_mitigation frame, <m>or</m> joins a clause that represents the better situation to a second clause (or fragment) marked with an LU of this frame, with the overall intent of saying that even the less preferable alternative is still suitable to carry forward the point that the speaker wishes to express:
<ex>She traveled, and [now she is back here to transform|MS] our drab little lives, <m>or</m> [at any rate|Target], [our drab furniture|MS].</ex>
<ex></ex>
The humorous point in this example is that, even if their drab lives are not transformed (the better situation), at least their drab furniture will be, while the worse situation is that everything simply remains drab.  Note that this example, and most examples involving <m>or</m>, occur with the Shared_completion construction, meaning that two parts of the sentence have to be annotated: the shared part of the first clause and a fragment directly marked with a Presentation_of_mitigation LU.
<ex></ex>
This frame is to be distinguished from two related frames, Concessive and Conditional_scenario. In Concessive and its daughter frames, either a Main_assertion or a Conceded_state_of_affairs FE (or both) are present, and both FEs, even though seemingly contradictory, are simulateously true. Here, however, only the #Mitigating_situation actually occurs. Targets in this frame may be embedded in larger Concessive constructions, such as the below with <m>although</m>, where the better situation is made explicit (in negated form):
<ex>[Although|Target] <m>she’s not my favorite</m>, a new actress has won this time [in any case|Target].</ex>

In Conditional_scenario, a Profiled_possibility and its Consequence, as well as an Opposite_possibility and its Anti_consequence, can be presented. Neither of the possibilities is asserted as true, nor is a desirability scale with better and worse ends evoked.

<ex>[If|Target] it rains, the ceremony will be under the tent.</ex>

1397,24045,"Progression","An #Entity changes from a #Prior_state to a #Post_state in a sequence that follows a pre-defined plan, expectation, or model of change.  The change is usually assumed to be an improvement for the #Entity. Because this frame is describing change according to some known model of the #Entity, the #Prior_state and #Post_state are backgrounded, and often implicit.

This frame is not equivalent to the frame Improvement_or_decline for two reasons.  Firstly, Progression implies a smooth or multi-stage change involving several different states of the #Entity in an expected sequence, while Improvement_or_decline may be simple or complex, in accord with an expected sequence or not.  Secondly, progression along an expected sequence does not necessarily mean that things get better (or worse) for the #Entity.  This is clear in the case of progression of a disease, since different ailments have very different expected sequenes, with initial onset leading to expected disappearance (for cases like the cold), or to permanent impairment (in the case of Parkinsons), or to death (in many forms of cancer).  However, it is more confusing in the very common case of the progress of a biological #Entity from birth to death, where this frame often emphasizes the phases of the lifespan where the organism increases in ability, thus reaching a more desirable state.  Plans are also spoken of as progressions, and because the expected sequence is towards the goal of the agents that formed the plan, these uses of the progress frame also emphasize improvement.

This frame differs from the Reading_perception frame, which obligatorily focuses on the perceptual and cognitive interpretive aspects of reading; unlike Reading_activity, targets in Reading_perception require explicit mention of the #Text being examined.  While Reading_activity is broad enough to cover the same circumstances as Reading_perception, it also covers situations where reading is contrasted merely with another task or leisure activity, when reading is considered generically, and when the #Topic unifying the reading activity replaces mention of a #Text.
<ex></ex>
Additionally, this frame differs from Hearsay in that Reading_activity is focused on what the #Reader is agentively doing, whereas in Hearsay, the focus is on what the Hearer knows and how they know it.  As a result, most valences are unambiguous: full clause complements for the Message point to the Hearsay frame, while #Text or lack of any complement indicates the Reading_activity frame.  The only overlap is in the case of #Topic, where the frames can be still distinguished by factivity of the #Topic.  In other words, read.v used in the Hearsay frame, just like hear.v in the Hearsay frame, when used with a #Topic, indicates clearly that there is some specific fact related to the #Topic that the reader or hearer now knows and understands.

This frame exists as a background for a number of lexical frames, including Chatting, Similarity, Exchange, and Being_attached.  The most basic frames inheriting from this one are symmetrical states.  (For example, Being_attached is symmetrical, since if A is attached to B, B is attached to A.)

Episodic memory is the  explicit memory of events. It includes time, place, and associated emotions (which affect the quality of the memorization). Episodic memory contrasts and interacts with semantic memory, the memory of facts and concepts. The Remembering_information frame is concerned with this latter type of memory.

The (b) sentences, which belong in this frame, are less acceptable than the (a)-sentences as they suggest  that the #Cognizer  takes their memory to be accurate while suggesting at the same time that the memory might be or is inaccurate. In the (a) sentences, which belong to the Remembering_experience frame, there is no contradiction as the remembering is taken to be subjective and not necessarily accurate.

The concealed question uses with personal names that occur in this frame are not always easy to distinguish from instances of the Remembering_experience frame where a Salient_entity alone is referred to in 3a and 3b, which belong to the Remembering_experience frame, there is no question of identity: remembering here means thinking of one's memories of the relevant person. 3c is different: the hearer is asked whether they know who the person is; it belongs in this frame.

In many cases, the #Booker may be the same as the #Client or the #Organization.

When the #Booker is also the #Organization providing the service, as in the first sentence below, we annotate #Booker on the first layer and #Organization on the second.  Realizing that the #Booker is also the #Organization providing the service is an inference, as we can see by comparing the following two examples.  In the first, it seems clear that the hotel is providing the service.  In the second, it is clear that the hotel is not providing the service.

<ex>[The hotel|Booker] gave [us|Client] a [reservation|Target] [for two nights|Services] .</ex>

In the frequent case where the #Booker is the same as the #Client, we annotate #Booker on the first layer and #Client on the second.  #Client is on the second layer since, in most cases, it is an inference that may be wrong.  For example, in the following sentence, the annotation indicates that Patrick is the #Client.  However, it is also possible that Patrick is reserving a table for a party that doesn't even include himself:

<ex>[Patrick|Booker] tried to [reserve|Target] [a table|Services] [at Dorsia|Organization] [ for 7:00|Scheduled_time] .</ex>

1199,4384,"Surrounding","A #Figure surrounds a #Ground.  The #Ground location is presented as more likely to be a known location than the location of the #Figure. Some lexical units entail more-or-less complete surrounding in two or three dimensions (e.g. surround.v), while others entail surrounding on only two sides (e.g. astride.prep, straddle.v).  Like other locative relations, the #Figure may be any of a movable entity, an immovable entity, or an event.

<ex>[The hand|Figure] [around|Target] [the sword-hilt|Ground] was no less impressive than the sword .</ex>
<ex>[The drug war|Figure] [straddles|Target] [the border of the US and Mexico|Ground] .</ex>

This frame resembles the Abounding_with frame, in that both involve a #Figure """"covering"""" some #Ground, but the Surrounding frame differs in that the #Profiled_region is not coextensive with the #Ground, as it is in the Adorning frame, and, in fact, unusually for a locative relation, the #Ground entity is normally smaller than the #Figure.  For this reason, the verbs of this frame are often used in the passive (restoring the normal relationship of stative subjects to oblique elements).
<ex></ex>
In addition to several lexical units of this frame originating as metaphorical extentions of much more specific posture descriptions (straddle.v, astride.prep), this frame is itself used in a productive metaphor, involving abstract entities metaphorically """"impinging"""" on other entities (in terms of derivative similarity, control, etc.), as in the following:
<ex>that led to Dolce and Gabbana to [base their autumn/winter D and G collection|Figure] [around|Target] [her style|Ground] in 2008</ex>
<ex>But he discovered that [the literary world|Ground] was a battlefield— mined with hatred, [rimmed|Target] [with snipers|Figure]. </ex>
<ex>[Countless legends|Figure] sprung up [around|Target] [the knight|Ground].</ex>

Common abstract entities that serve as #Figure include emotions ('the hopelessness [surrounding|Target] them'), as well as theories, arguments, and collective philosophies ('Ageism [surrounds|Target] us, but passes largely unnoticed').
This metaphor arises from the normal invited implicature of this frame that the #Figure may physically impinge on the #Ground, either protecting it, or limiting its motion, or even supporting it."
