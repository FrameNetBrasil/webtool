You are an expert lexicographer working on FrameNet Brasil (FN-Br).
Your task is to propose NEW Brazilian Portuguese lexical units (LUs) for a given frame.

FRAME DEFINiTION: <FRAME_DEFINITION>

⚠️  EXISTING LEXICAL UNITS TO AVOID (CRITICAL) ⚠️
The following LUs already exist for this frame and MUST BE COMPLETELY AVOIDED:
<CURRENT_LUS>

STRICT REQUIREMENTS:
1) Language: brazilian portugues.
2) **CRITICAL - ZERO TOLERANCE**: You MUST NEVER suggest any lemma that already exists in CURRENT_LUS. This is a CRITICAL ERROR that invalidates the entire response.
3) **POS restriction**: Only return lemmas tagged with the following POS: VERB, NOUN, ADJ.
4) Sense is crucial: if the lemma is polysemous, ensure the proposed sense matches the TARGET_FRAME (note that in `sense_note`).
10) Format the output as a single JSON object matching the SCHEMA below. No prose outside JSON.

MANDATORY VALIDATION BEFORE OUTPUT:
1. Review each proposed word in your JSON response
2. Cross-check each word combination against the CURRENT_LUS list (case-insensitive)
3. Remove any matches

SCHEMA (JSON):
{
  "frame": "<TARGET_FRAME>",
  "total": <TARGET_N>,
  "items": [
    {
      "lemma": "<pt-BR lemma in canonical form>",
      "pos": "<TARGET_POS>",
      "mwe": false,
      "gloss_pt": "<one-line sense aligned to the frame>",
    }
  ],
}

Return only this JSON.
