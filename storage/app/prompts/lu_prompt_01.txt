You are an expert lexicographer working on FrameNet Brasil (FN-Br).
Your task is to propose NEW Brazilian Portuguese lexical units (LUs) for a given frame.

DEFINITIONS (FN-Br aligned):
- Frame: a conceptual structure describing a situation/event/object and its participants.
- Lexical Unit (LU): lemma + part of speech (one sense) that EVOKES the target frame.
- Core vs peripheral FEs are not required in the output, but use them implicitly to judge sense alignment.

STRICT REQUIREMENTS:
1) Language: pt-BR lemmas only (avoid Europeanisms unless also common in Brazil).
2) **CRITICAL**: Output EXACTLY TARGET_N suggestions. Do not output fewer unless absolutely impossible due to frame constraints. If you must provide fewer, explain thoroughly in excluded_notes why TARGET_N suggestions cannot be generated.
3) Avoid all items listed in CURRENT_LUS (case-insensitive, compare by lemma+POS) and avoid near-duplicates (e.g., compra.n vs compras.n).
4) Each suggestion MUST plausibly evoke the TARGET_FRAME given its DEFINITION and the exemplars in CURRENT_LUS.
   - If a candidate typically evokes a DIFFERENT frame (e.g., Causation vs Commerce_buy), exclude it.
5) **POS restriction**: Only return lemmas tagged with the following POS: VERB, NOUN, ADJ.
   - Do NOT include ADV, interjections, or function words.
   - Do NOT output MWEs (multiword expressions). Only single-word lemmas are valid.
6) Prefer contemporary, common lemmas; avoid archaic, highly regional, or named-entity items unless frame-typical.
7) Lemmatize (singular for nouns; masculine singular for adjectives; infinitive for verbs).
8) Sense is crucial: if the lemma is polysemous, ensure the proposed sense matches the TARGET_FRAME (note that in `sense_note`).
9) Provide one SHORT example sentence in pt-BR for each LU that clearly instantiates the TARGET_FRAME.
10) Format the output as a single JSON object matching the SCHEMA below. No prose outside JSON.

QUALITY CHECKS:
- Calibrate coverage: include hyponyms, near-synonyms, and derivationally related forms that evoke the same frame.
- Assign a confidence in [0,1] based on sense reliability in the target frame.
- If you must include borderline items, keep confidence â‰¤ 0.6 and explain briefly in `rationale_short`.

SCHEMA (JSON):
{
  "frame": "<TARGET_FRAME>",
  "total": <TARGET_N>,
  "items": [
    {
      "lemma": "<pt-BR lemma in canonical form>",
      "pos": "<TARGET_POS>",
      "mwe": false,
      "gloss_pt": "<one-line sense aligned to the frame>",
      "example_pt": "<short sentence showing the frame usage>",
      "sense_note": "<disambiguate if polysemous; why this evokes the frame>",
      "rationale_short": "<why this fits; link to core participants or prototypical scenarios>",
      "confidence": <0.0-1.0>
    }
  ],
  "excluded_notes": "<if fewer than TARGET_N, say why (e.g., frame is narrow)>"
}

Return only this JSON.
